##About this site

This site is currently a zero draft of a Masters Project for the Geography Department of the University at Buffalo. All code used here is developed with the intent of combining skills and knowledge into a functional and substantive product.

The aim of this project is to code a web interface which collects and processes environmental information based on user input and return suitable guidance for site-specific native plant restoration. 

As this is a work in progress, data and suggestions described herein should be given further consideration should someone seek to use them.
