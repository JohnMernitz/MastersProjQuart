If you would like to know more about this tool and its functionality, please check the about and code steps on the navbar above!\nAgain, this plant selector is not fully tested, plants should be carefully considered if they are appropriate for one’s needs. This page seeks to diversify thoughts and choices about native plants in gardens; do not blindly choose one. Please be aware some of these plants have natural defenses like thorns, irritating sap, or inedible fruits!\nSuggestions are organized by hydrologic and wetland proximity, annual or perennial, and by growth type.\n\n\nLibraries\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(htmlwidgets)\nlibrary(widgetframe)\ninstall.packages(\"DT\")\nlibrary(DT)\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(widgetframe_widgets_dir = 'widgets' ) \nknitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)  # cached results for quick compiling\n\n\n\n\nPlant Selector\n\n\n\nCurtesy of USACE Definitions, used analogous to water tolerance.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nnative_plants &lt;- read.csv(\"data/common_plants.csv\")\n\n#Here we'll edit the columns so not as much data needs to be loaded\n\nnative2 &lt;- native_plants[,c(\"Scientific_Name\", \"Common_Name\", \"CoC\", \"nwpl_ncne\", \"Growth_Habit\", \"Duration\")]\n\n#Now we have fewer columns, let's edit the column names so it's more clear what each refers to\n\ndatatable(\n  native2,\n  colnames = c('Scientific Name' = 2, 'Common Name' = 3,'Difficulty' = 4, 'Wetland Status' = 5, 'Growth Type' = 6), \n  filter = 'top',\n  options = list(pagelength=5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nn=20\ndata=data.frame(x=runif(n,-180,180),\n                y=runif(n,-60,60),\n                size = runif(n, 5, 20),\n                category = factor(\n                  sample(letters[1:5], n, replace = TRUE)\n                  ),\n                value = rnorm(n))\n\n\n\nCode\ndata %&gt;% \n  slice(1:10) %&gt;% #show only 1:n rows\n  kable(digits=2,align=\"c\")%&gt;% #make table and round to two digits\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = \n                  c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\", \"responsive\")) #apply other formatting\n\n\n\n\n\nx\ny\nsize\ncategory\nvalue\n\n\n\n\n-154.37\n-37.73\n8.93\nc\n-0.39\n\n\n-76.29\n46.25\n8.05\na\n-0.14\n\n\n80.70\n-15.58\n10.68\nb\n-1.13\n\n\n-59.72\n-53.66\n16.95\nc\n-0.18\n\n\n65.24\n-13.68\n18.81\nb\n0.05\n\n\n-84.04\n-37.10\n15.50\nd\n-1.85\n\n\n-126.85\n-27.87\n12.33\ne\n0.87\n\n\n-8.43\n28.11\n14.81\nc\n-0.06\n\n\n-133.11\n28.25\n7.46\nb\n0.96\n\n\n150.33\n10.68\n9.96\na\n1.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nm &lt;- leaflet(data) %&gt;% \n  addTiles() %&gt;% #Openstreetmaps default\n  addCircleMarkers(~x, ~y, radius = ~size,color = ~as.factor(category)) %&gt;% \n  addPopups(~x[2], ~y[2], \"Random popup\")\nm  # a map with the default OSM tile layer\n\n\n\n\nMap of completely random data"

    "text": "Principles\nEcosystem resilience requires a wide base to stand upon. Biodiversity, the many different plants and insects and animals that make up an ecosystem, are reliant on local conditions they have grown with over thousands of years. In the interest of increasing the ability of nature to resist change by humans, through land use and other means, it is vital that people be aware of native plants.\nThe capacity to know and choose native plants for their gardens and homes is very important. Too often, the choice is made by nurseries and standard garden ideals that popular non-native plants sell best. Due to there being little alternative or little knowledge of them, native plants are not chosen. This project seeks to help with that.\nWith coding and computer data storage, creating a tool which can act as a skeleton for repeated queries is achievable. The Native Plant Finder is an attempt to construct a template site that can be copied in any other scalable location. Ideally, just changing base files and plant data will allow user experiences to be similar."
