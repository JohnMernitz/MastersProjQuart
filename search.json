If you would like to know more about this tool and its functionality, please check the about and code steps on the navbar above!\nAgain, this plant selector is not fully tested, plants should be carefully considered if they are appropriate for one’s needs. This page seeks to diversify thoughts and choices about native plants in gardens; do not blindly choose one. Please be aware some of these plants have natural defenses like thorns, irritating sap, or inedible fruits!\nSuggestions are organized by hydrologic and wetland proximity, annual or perennial, and by growth type."

    "text": "#Underlying Principles\nThe shapefiles within this project are from the Town of Amherst’s GIS division, and from the New York Natural Heritage Program(NYNHP). From a combination of the hydrographic and wetland layers of Amherst, a buffer layer was composed to encompass a quarter mile around those features. Similarly, a buffer around the NYNHP was created to provide an extended range wherein various plants of that biome would be recommended in priority.\n#Database Organization\nThe plants data in this project is currently a product of David Werier and the New York Flora Association, who allowed permission of its use in this project. Plants therein are those documented by NYFA in their Atlas project as native to Erie County, albeit acknowledging that their list is not complete. The list of plants has the fields of scientific name, common name,family, genus, species, infraspecies, Coefficient of Conservatism, State Status, National Wetland Plant List code for Northcentral and Northeast, State Rank, Global Rank, Habitat, Growth Habit, and Duration.\n##Data Management\nThe data is divided into the above categories, but also must be split due to New York laws about threatened, endangered and rare species. It is forbidden to cause any bother or harm to these species, and so their data must be partitioned.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nplant_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Copy_NYFA_Erie_Native_pared.csv\")\n#Downloading data\n\n\nThis first section divides the data based on threat status. Extirpated plants should be removed as well.\n\n\nCode\nplant_data &lt;- plant_data %&gt;%\n  filter(plant_data[,14] != \"SX\")\n         \ncommon_plants &lt;- plant_data %&gt;%\n  filter(!(plant_data[,12] %in% c(\"Endangered-State\", \"Threatened-State\", \"Rare-State\")))\n#first filter for non-threatened data\n\nthreatened_plants &lt;- plant_data %&gt;%\n  filter(plant_data[,12] %in% c(\"Endangered-State\", \"Threatened-State\", \"Rare-State\"))\n#second filter for threatened plant species\n\n\nValues should be assigned to the wetland codes of the plants, to better qualify their need for water.\nAnother few splits should be added here to partition plants which require more wet and more dry conditions.\n##Calling Data\nLayer files from the project are transformed into geojson for call expediency and ease of display.\n##Display\n#Site Aesthetics and Utility\n#Linked Paper\n#Citations"

    "text": "About this site\nThis site is currently a zero draft of a Masters Project for the Geography Department of the University at Buffalo. All code used here is developed with the intent of combining skills and knowledge into a functional and substantive product.\nThe aim of this project is to code a web interface which collects and processes environmental information based on user input and return suitable guidance for site-specific native plant restoration.\nAs this is a work in progress, data and suggestions described herein should be given further consideration should someone seek to use them.\nPrinciples\nEcosystem resilience requires a wide base to stand upon. Biodiversity, the many different plants and insects and animals that make up an ecosystem, are reliant on local conditions they have grown with over thousands of years. In the interest of increasing the ability of nature to resist change by humans, through land use and other means, it is vital that people be aware of native plants.\nThe capacity to know and choose native plants for their gardens and homes is very important. Too often, the choice is made by nurseries and standard garden ideals that popular non-native plants sell best. Due to there being little alternative or little knowledge of them, native plants are not chosen. This project seeks to help with that.\nWith coding and computer data storage, creating a tool which can act as a skeleton for repeated queries is achievable. The Native Plant Finder is an attempt to construct a template site that can be copied in any other scalable location. Ideally, just changing base files and plant data will allow user experiences to be similar."
